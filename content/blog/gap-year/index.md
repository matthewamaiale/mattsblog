## Why I left school.

We enter college with unbounded career aspirations. We set out to be neuroscientists, politicians, artists, and for me an entrepreneur. Then we become [conformists](http://www.paulgraham.com/conformism.html).

*We don’t listen to ourselves.*

I was told that if I checked all the boxes I could do whatever I wanted. I got a high gpa, held leadership positions, and secured an internship.
Yet as I kept checking the boxes I saw my optionality dwindle.

I let my ego get the best of me and strived towards what others saw as successful — not what I wanted. 

No matter how much pushed in the same direction I wouldn’t reach my original aspirations.

Halfway through my sophomore year I ultimately decided I needed to start from scratch.

I left school in spring 2020 — and it has been the best decision of my life. During the first 8 months of my gap year I worked at a seed venture capital fund in San Francisco, got exposure to Silicon Valley, and ultimately joined an incredible growth marketing startup.

I’ll share my experience on how I left as a non-technical background, afforded to live in San Francisco, and ended up readjusted my entire life trajectory.

## Start with a side-gig

If there’s something you’re yearning to learn, don’t always settle for what’s in the classroom.

I became extremely excited by technology and equally frustrated by the lack of opportunities offered by the university. In fact the majority of my exploration came by joining incredible student orgs such as [Happy Valley Capital](http://www.hvcpsu.com/).

Before I left I started supplementing my education by working remotely for startups. I’d cold email founders that fascinated me and offer to help as a part-time intern (no strings attached). 

To my surprise, most startups were extremely receptive and respected my drive to reshape my college career. 

All while taking a full course load, I joined a blockchain company based in Switzerland, then later a FinTech YC startup in San Francisco.

Whether you decide to disenroll from school and fly across the country, or take an extra 10 hours from your week, I’ll walk you through how to let this remote environment be an opportunity to explore your own curiosities.

**Where to find remote opportunities**
  - [angel.co](http://www.angel.co/) (where I started)
  - [workatastartup.com](http://www.workatastartup.com/) (For Y Combinator startups)
  - On-campus clubs (entrepreneurship focused)

## Be open to different opportunities

The first two startups I joined in college were unpaid part-time positions — and the return on investment was remarkable. 

Part-time internships are the most uniquely valuable way to peek inside a company without committing 2+ years of your life.

You also don't know where opportunities will lead you. While working for the FinTech startup in San Francisco, I got connected to an incredible opportunity in venture capital.

What excited me about the opportunity was that venture capital is one of the easiest ways to segway from a finance background into tech. 

All during finals week I completed a 3-part interview, got the offer, disenrolled from class, and packed up my dorm room.


### Taking a leave of absence

There's so much inconsistency in college. Exams, projects, and social events that take up every hour from your day. It becomes nearly impossible to focus on side-projects.

In January of 2020, I flew out to San Francisco for the first time on my own. Taking a complete pause from school helped me refocus on what I wanted to accomplish -- learning and networking in technology.

Although, my intentions may be different than yours — if you're just looking for experience then there's nothing stopping you from taking a lighter course load, going part-time, or supplementing your free-time. 

You need to first assess what you want to accomplish then work backward.

**Books that influenced my gap year**
  - Range
  - Ego is the Enemy
  - Zero to One

## Become an expert in something unique

Whether you decide to take off the year or only dedicate a few hours each week, you'll get to build moats — uniquely valuable skills.

Between both my part-time internships and gap year I learned how to raise a fund, due diligence + invest in startups, and ultimately what it takes to start a company. 

While none of these skills necessarily built off each other and my journey has been extremely non-linear, the diversity of perspectives helps me think more critically.

For instance, working in Biz Dev at 2 startups gave me a unique perspective while due diligencing startups in venture capital.

But nothing the copy said could convince her and so it didn’t take long until a
few insidious Copy Writers ambushed her, made her drunk with
[Longe and Parole](http://google.com) and dragged her into their agency, where
they abused her for their projects again and again. And if she hasn’t been
rewritten, then they are still using her.

It is a paradisematic country, in which roasted parts of sentences fly into your
mouth. Even the all-powerful Pointing has no control about the blind texts it is

name of Lorem Ipsum decided to leave for the far World of Grammar.

The Big Oxmox advised her not to do so, because there were thousands of bad
Commas, wild Question Marks and devious Semikoli, but the Little Blind Text
didn’t listen. She packed her seven versalia, put her initial into the belt and
made herself on the way.

When she reached the first hills of the Italic Mountains, she had a last view
back on the skyline of her hometown Bookmarksgrove, the headline of Alphabet
Village and the subline of her own road, the Line Lane. Pityful a rhetoric
question ran over her cheek, then she continued her way. On her way she met a
copy.

Separated they live in Bookmarksgrove right at the coast of the Semantics, a
