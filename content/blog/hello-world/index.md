A too common response when mentioned that I run is, “… Why?”, and to my surprise, I really don’t have a concrete refutation.

The sport is a pain; I spontaneously get cramps, wake up sore, end workouts light-headed, and have even suffered a heat stroke mid-race; so “… Why?”.

In Layman’s terms, I run because I simply enjoy it: but that’s not a sufficient answer, right?
Expectancy Theory:

To initially determine the origin of my motivation, I am examining Vroom’s Expectancy Theory. Victor H. Vroom’s theory suggests that our initial motivation derives from our expected outcome. To break this down further, our actions can be divided into the logical progression:
Motivation → (Effort → Performance → Reward) → Satisfaction

Interesting though, our motivation is based on our perceived capability to covert our initial effort to performance (Expectancy), then our performance to a reward (Instrumentality), then finally turn the reward into intrinsic satisfaction (Valance).

Therefore, Motivation = Expectancy * Instrumentality * Valance.

If either expectancy, instrumentality, or valance is not fulfilled, then motivation will be diminished.
To give an example, let's say that you’re training to walk onto your Division 1 school’s cross country team. The coach tells you that he will consider putting you on the team if you run faster than the 7th runner.

Step 1. Expectancy (effort → performance):
If you believe the performance (beating the 7th runner) is pragmatic based on the effort (training), then your expectancy is satisfied.

Step 2. Instrumentality (performance → reward):
Since the coach said he will consider you if you perform (beat the 7th runner), then your instrumentality is based on the likelihood of getting placed on the team. If the coach is known to stick to his word, then your instrumentality is satisfied.

Step 3. Valance (reward → satisfaction):
Satisfaction from a reward is relative; do you even want to be on the cross country team? If joining the team has been a dream, then your valance will be satisfied.
As a result, all 3 components of motivation were fulfilled and the effort became satisfaction.
Relating back to the everyday runner, the motivation process is just as relevant. Whether it is training for a half marathon or lasting 2.5 miles without taking a break, an undeniable amount of time, energy, and pain is sacrificed to accomplish our goals.

This invokes the question: what reward’s satisfaction trumps the effort of running? Were the countless hours and months of training worth coming in 24th at the local 5k? From an outside perspective: no; but any runner can testify that their satisfaction lies beyond winning any trophy or prize.

Herzberg’s Two Factor Theory:
Therefore, to measure the amount of satisfaction from running, I am using Herzberg’s 2-factor theory. Originally created to determine the causes of satisfaction in the workplace, Fredrick Herzberg’s theory is applicable to any commitment. The theory is called ‘2-factor’ because it is broken down into two requisites: Hygiene and Motivators.
Hygiene needs are external conditions demanded such as comfortable pay, affiliation, and physical conditions.
However, like most other runners, I am not professionally signed, on a scholarship, or get any monetary benefit from running. The closest thing to a monetary prize I’ve received are free shirts from winning races. There’s little affiliation received from running since virtually no one watches cross country races (thanks, mom and dad). Finally, the physical conditions are brutal; with a goal in mind, there are no days off whether it’s an excessive heat wave or two feet of snow.

Instead, satisfaction comes from internal motivator needs: a sense of achievement, goal-setting triumphs, and the long lasting relationships I’ve built with likeminded runners. Unlike hygiene needs, I can’t put a price tag on the intrinsic satisfaction of running.

Every day I look forward most to changing from my business casual dress to split short-shorts for a long, relaxing run. As I glide through the windy trails, I step away from my phone, stress, and all of life’s distractions. As I tirelessly focus on finish my workout, it’s as if I escape the status-quo and my responsibilities.

Runners aren’t motivated by the materialism of trophies, fanbases, nor money, but rather the intangible rewards from giving your heart and soul to the sport. My running journey of ups and downs has provided me grateful memories that cannot be written with pen and paper.

So to answer what motivates me to run: I don’t know; why don’t you give it a try and see?
